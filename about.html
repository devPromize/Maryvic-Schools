                  Maryvic recognises the importance of balance to parents: the
                  need to successfully juggle work and family life and to find a
                  school that cater for the educational, emotional and physical
                  needs of your child….that gives you peace of mind! Cotville provides just that!

                  Once you enroll your child at Maryvic, we become partners.
                  Our goal is to ensure that you feel relaxed at work or
                  wherever else you need to be, knowing that your child is cared
                  for in a safe, loving and simulating environment that is
                  healthy for his or her growth and development. The children
                  are given the individual attention, resources and space in
